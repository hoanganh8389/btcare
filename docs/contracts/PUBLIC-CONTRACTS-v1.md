# BizCity Twin Public Contracts v1

> **Directive:** Johnny Chu - Chu Hoàng Anh · 2026-09-13

Status: Stable (catalog 1.9.0, 26 contracts)
Catalog source: core/twin-core/contracts/schema/public/v1/contract-catalog.json
SemVer policy: semver

## Enterprise Brain contract boundary

These public contracts are the extension boundary for the Enterprise Brain
direction. A producer or consumer must fit the shared spine: Channel Gateway
normalizes horizontal enterprise inputs, Vertical Brain Modes provide
contract-based capabilities, and KG Graph/Graph RAG supplies knowledge evidence.
Chatbot, GPT/Twin GPT, Profile, Landing Page, Automation, and Notes consume or
extend these contracts; they must not create parallel brains or siloed data
paths. MCP and AI tools remain governed by identity, tenant, permission, and
evidence contracts.

See [PHASE-0-RULE-ENTERPRISE-BRAIN-DIRECTION.md](../rules/PHASE-0-RULE-ENTERPRISE-BRAIN-DIRECTION.md),
[PHASE-0-RULE-BRAIN-UNIFICATION.md](../rules/PHASE-0-RULE-BRAIN-UNIFICATION.md),
and [PHASE-0-RULE-CONTEXT-BANK.md](../rules/PHASE-0-RULE-CONTEXT-BANK.md)
before adding a public contract.

### Channel diagnostics contract

`channel-diagnostics-record` is the public management/observability contract
for every channel plugin and module. It requires exact tenant, channel, zone and
account scope, structured event/stage metadata, producer identity and separate
pipeline statuses:

```text
operational_logged
context_captured
ledger_indexed
kg_candidate
```

The canonical Zalo channel IDs are `zalo_bot`, `zalo_oa` and
`zalo_personal`. A generic `zalo` value is not accepted at the public boundary.
Each channel supports multiple accounts; readers must filter exact account
scope server-side. Runtime adoption remains pending until the CB-CH writer,
reader, shared UI and multi-account probes pass.

## Context Bank Contracts

The following contracts are now registered in the stable public catalog. Their
schemas and valid/invalid fixtures are covered by the
contract runner. Runtime producer/consumer adoption and Context Bank probes
remain separate pending gates:

1. `context-bank-record`
2. `context-rollup-definition`
3. `context-relation`
4. `context-retrieval-pack`
Evidence uses the existing stable `diagnostics-verdict` contract; no separate
`context-bank-verdict` contract is defined.

Until runtime adoption is proven, CLI/framework inventory must label these rows
`catalog=stable`, `runtime=pending`. Existing stable contracts such as
`channel-payload`, `event-envelope`, `kg-adapter-payload`, `citation-pack`,
`permission-scopes`, `runtime-execution-policy` and `diagnostics-verdict` remain
their required dependencies.

### Extension storage and Context Bank adoption contract

`extension-storage-context@1.0.0` is the public decision boundary for every
extension that creates, migrates or consumes data that may be reused by Context
Bank, KG-Hub or MPR/TwinBrain. It does not force every object into a table or
every object into JSONL. It requires an explicit, machine-readable decision:

```text
log/trace/audit
	-> contracted JSONL logger / encrypted filestore as appropriate

important reusable context/business record
	-> encrypted Business JSONL File Store
	-> lock-captured write receipt
	-> pointer-only bizcity_context_bank ledger
	-> rollup or explicit no-rollup decision

small low-volume configuration/profile/editorial data
	-> existing CPT / option / site option / user meta / existing repository

large, atomic, relational or hot-path correctness state
	-> typed tenant SQL/canonical repository
	-> Context Bank adapter or explicit reviewed no-context decision
	-> bounded context-retrieval-pack/MPR bridge when reusable evidence exists
```

The contract requires `storage_decisions[]`, `context_bank`, `mpr_bridge` and
`evidence`. A new SQL table without a storage decision, receipt/ledger policy,
rollup decision and retrieval/MPR boundary is not an accepted extension shape.

The schema and fixtures are located at:

```text
core/twin-core/contracts/schema/public/v1/extension-storage-context.schema.json
core/twin-core/contracts/schema/public/v1/fixtures/extension-storage-context.*.json
```

Manifest v1.x accepts this metadata additively as `storage_context`. PHASE-1.22A
and the next manifest major version may require it for `vertical_extension`,
`framework_integrated` and `channel_owner` packages. Runtime Context Bank and
MPR adoption remains a separate Disk/Loader/Runtime gate; a valid fixture is not
runtime proof.

## Deprecation Policy

- A public contract field cannot be removed in the same major line.
- A field marked deprecated must remain supported for at least 3 minor versions.
- Breaking changes require a major version bump of that contract.
- New required fields are breaking changes and must wait for next major.
- New optional fields are minor changes and are backward-compatible.
- Contract tests must include one valid fixture and one invalid fixture per contract.

## Stable vs Internal Boundary

Stable API:

- JSON contract schemas under core/twin-core/contracts/schema/public/v1.
- SDK interfaces in core/twin-core/contracts/framework-contracts.php.
- `BizCity_Phone_Normalizer_Interface::normalize_vn()` — canonical phone identity contract for CRM/Woo/loyalty/channel sources.
- SDK interfaces in core/twin-core/contracts/content-contracts.php.
- Manifest schema in core/twin-core/contracts/schema/manifest.schema.json.
- Admin navigation schema in core/twin-core/contracts/schema/public/v1/admin-navigation.schema.json.

Internal API (no compatibility guarantee):

- Class internals under core/*/includes except explicit interfaces.
- Private helper functions and cache internals.
- Diagnostics probes and internal cron wiring.
- Feature-specific SQL columns not exposed by public schemas.

## Contract Tests

Run:

- node core/twin-core/contracts/tests/run-contract-tests.mjs

Expected output for the current stable catalog:

- CONTRACT TESTS PASS (26 contracts)
